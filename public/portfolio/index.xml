      <title>Cardiac MRI Autopilot â€“ Proof of Concept</title>

      <description>Cardiac MRI is an advanced imaging technique to understand heart health. Despite the medical utility of this technology, it&amp;rsquo;s accessibility is often limited due to the complex anatomy of the heart, and difficulty in training technologists to acquire high quality images.
In this work, I therefore developed a deep learning (AI) based approach to automate these scans. Using several hundred scans, I developed 2D and 3D deep learning models in Keras (with tensorflow) to localize the cardiac landmarks that define the standard cardiac views.</description>

      <description>For a Robotics in Healthcare class I took from UC San Diego&amp;rsquo;s CS department, our term project was to design and prototype a healthcare technology. Given my background in healthcare, I knew of the importance health systems were placing on developing post surgical monitoring programs, such as hiring nurses to monitor patients after they were discharged to their homes. However, these programs are often highly labor intensive, and therefore often difficult to implement.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty Sampling for Heatmap Localization</title>

      <description>While there have been prior examinations of using uncertainty sampling for Deep Convolutional Neural Networks, this prior work has been limited to problems like classification. However for my problem of localization, there has not been generalization of these approaches for my problem of heatmap localization.
In this work, I examine three different strategies for measuring Deep Convolutional Neural Network uncertainty; 1) pseudoprobability maximum based off the Deep Convolutional Neural Network activation, 2) spatial variance of rotational entropy based off augmentations of the test images, and 3) a Bayesian uncertainty metric based off applying random dropout to the network.</description>
