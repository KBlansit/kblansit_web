In this work, I developed a proof of concept to automate the scans of Cardiac MRI scans. Cardiac MRI scans are often limited to community MRI facilities due to the complex anatomy of the heart. To increase the accessibility of this technology, I developed a series of 2D and 3D Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (A.I.) to identify the cardiac landmarks that define the cardiac views (localized within <1cm).
