Hi!

After growing up in the Sierra Nevada mountains, I attended college at UC Davis, graduating in 2011 with my Bachelor's degree in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology.

I started my career at UCSF, doing translational oncology research using molecular wet lab and bioinformatics techniques. Subsequently, I worked at Palo Alto Medical Foundation, where I led the biostatistical analysis for precision medicine therapeutics in ovarian cancer. I was moreover responsible for developing a statistical model for predicting surgical complications and resulting hospital financial consequences. This involved creating complex data pipelines from administrative data sources.

I decided to then pursue formal graduate level education in utilizing healthcare technology effectively, receiving my master’s degree from UCLA’s Health Policy and Management. During the same time, I worked as a programmer at the Center for Health Policy Research, where I was the lead developer for a health insurance micro-simulation (CalSIM) to model the effects of implementing healthcare reform. This position required programming complex python code to accurately simulate economic decision-making behavior.

More recently, I am finishing my Ph.D. at UC San Diego’s Bioinformatics program, focusing my thesis work on developing a cardiac MRI ‘autopilot’, meant to integrate and automate with cardiac MRI workflows. I developed a series of Deep Convolutional Neural Networks to localize the cardiac landmarks that define the standard cardiac views. This range of my worked transcends from developing novel deep learning algorithms to implementing my work into a fully functional clinical prototype.

In my free time, I enjoy running, home brewing, cooking, and thinkering with computers.
