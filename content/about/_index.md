Hi!

After growing up in the Sierra Nevada mountains, I went to college at UC Santa Cruz for two years, subsequently graduating from UC Davis with my B.S. in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology.

I first worked at UCSF doing translational oncology research using molecular wet lab and bioinformatics techniques. Subsequently, I worked at Palo Alto Medical Foundation, where I led the biostatistical analysis for precision medicine therapeutics in ovarian cancer. I was moreover responsible for developing a statistical model for predicting surgical complications, and the financial consequences of these complications. This involved creating complex data pipelines from administrative data sources.

I then matriculated to UCLA’s Health Policy and Management, I worked as a programmer at the Center for Health Policy Research, where I was the lead developer for a health insurance micro-simulation to model the effects of implementing health reform. This position required programming complex python code to accurately simulate economic decision-making behavior. During this time, I also focused my graduate level studies on how to use healthcare technology effectively within a healthcare enterprise.

More recently, I have focused my graduate research work on developing a cardiac MRI ‘autopilot’, meant to integrate and automate with cardiac MRI workflows. I developed a series of Deep Convolutional Neural Networks to localize the cardiac landmarks that define the standard cardiac views. This rang of my worked transcends from developing novel deep learning algorithms to implementing my work into a fully functional clinical prototype.

In my free time, I enjoy running, home brewing, cooking, and building computers.
